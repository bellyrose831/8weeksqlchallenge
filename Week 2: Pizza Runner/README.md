## Week 2 of the 8weekSQLChallenge: Pizza Runner

This case study (https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2) poses the scenario of Danny, a pizza shop owner who has started building out his business model. He now has an mobile app to accept pizza orders online and employs several pizza runners who are in charge of delivering pizzas to customers. Danny has been collecting data on the operation of his business and is looking to use the collected data to answer questions about his business. These questions fall into four major categories: Pizza Metrics (A), Runner and Customer Experience (B), Ingredient Optimisation (C), and Pricing and Ratings (D). In addition to answering the questions in those categories, Danny has requested that we clean the data in the tables and include a proposal for how he might go about adding a new type of pizza (such as Supreme) to the menu.
