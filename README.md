# 8weeksqlchallenge

As I'm working my way through the 8WeekSQLChallenge (found here: https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), I'll continue to update this repo with my solutions, along with explanations for the choices I've made in the code. I'm not planning to stick to a strict weekly schedule in uploading these, but looking to build and expand upon my SQL knowledge through these case studies!

For each challenge, I'll include the following files:
- README: for each 'week', I'll provide some context on the case study scenario & requirements
- LoadData: a sql file used to import the data for the case study
- Case Study Queries: a sql file with the questions and my code
- Solutions: a markdown file including my explanation, code, and the result for each question
